# What is this?

Terminal Shenanigans is a component meant to be used in Interactive Fiction for the purpose of easily displaying pre-written 'conversations' in a C terminal. In addition to displaying provided strings in sequence, users can specify the colors, pause between characters/lines, and 'speaker'. Scripts will then be played back in a C terminal.

This was primarily meant to simulate chat sessions in a terminal, but can also be used for shell sessions and any other situation where text would appear on a computer screen in a call-and-response manner.
